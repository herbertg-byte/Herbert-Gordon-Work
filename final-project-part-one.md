# Outline
This project will display the recent turbulence and key shifts within the global art market, using 2024 data as a pivot point. While the overall sales value of the art and antiques market declined by roughly 12 percent in 2024, totaling $57.5 billion U.S. dollars, the volume of transactions experienced an annual increase, reaching 40.5 million.
Using the provided data from the "Art market worldwide" study, I plan on displaying how the decrease of value and increase of sales shows the art market correcting its course. The visualization will argue that the market's high-end, speculative segments are stalling or collapsing (evidenced by major auction house declines), while the sustained increase in volume (transactions) confirms that the bottom and middle of the market is expanding or holding steady during turbulent financial and political times. The divergence of value down, and volume up is the central conflict of the story.

 
# My Plan 

My story will focus on the conflict between declining high-end revenue and increasing transaction frequency.
With the guiding prompt: The story will show that while political and economic turbulence caused the high-end art market value to contract sharply in 2024, the simultaneous increase in transaction volume suggests a shift of activity toward the resilient, high-frequency middle and lower market tiers.

## Story Points:


### 1
Exposition (The Contradiction): Establish the core market tension in 2024. Visualize the 12 percent decline in global sales value ($57.5 billion U.S. dollars) juxtaposed against the three percent annual increase in sales volume (40.5 million transactions). Establish the geographical dominance of traditional markets (US: 43%; UK: 18%).
###2
Rising Action (The Top Market Stalls): Detail the high-end contraction. Show that global sales for leading auction houses, Christie's and Sotheby's, declined significantly in 2024. Specifically, show that revenue from auctions in the painting market declined by roughly 26 percent in 2024, falling to $5.272 billion. This demonstrates the top of the market is contracting.

### 3 
Climax (The Correction/The Collapse of Speculation): Focus on the segment that corrected most violently: NFTs. Visualize the 65 percent fall in the value of art-related NFT transactions in 2024, amounting to only $213 million U.S. dollars. This crash signals the exit of speculative, high-risk capital from the market.
### 4
Falling Action (Middle Market Resilience): Show areas where volume and stability held firm. Contrast the public auction decline with the growth in private auction sales (up roughly 13 percent to $4.4 billion in 2024). Highlight the relative success of U.S.-based Heritage Auctions, whose total sales increased by 6.1 percent in 2024 to $1.87 billion U.S. dollars, reaching its highest figure to date. Finally, show that dealers remain the most popular channel for HNW collectors (88% used them in H1 2024), suggesting stable, high-frequency transactions persist outside the volatile top public auction segment.
### 5
Resolution (The Future Landscape and Turbulence): Conclude by reinforcing the idea that political/economic volatility is the primary challenge facing art dealers in 2024 (42% of respondents). This contextualizes the value contraction as a response to external instability, while volume stability indicates intrinsic market health.


# The data
The data for this project is sourced entirely from the "Art market worldwide" study. This report synthesizes information from various prominent art market institutions and providers, including UBS, Art Basel, Christie's, Sotheby's, and Statista.
I plan on using this data to construct a comprehensive view of the 2024 market environment, focusing on comparisons between segment performance. Specifically, I will utilize time series data to show long-term trends, and comparative distribution data to contrast the contraction in high-end auction markets with the growth or stability found in private markets and dealer channels.

# Method and medium
I plan on completing the final project by first extracting the necessary quantitative data points from the "Art market worldwide" source document into a structured spreadsheet. I will then use a suitable data visualization tool to create the three core comparative visualizations described in the sketches, ensuring they effectively communicate the divergence between high-end value contraction and middle-market volume stability. The final medium will be a static or interactive presentation integrating these charts to walk the user through the narrative of the marketâ€™s course correction in 2024.
