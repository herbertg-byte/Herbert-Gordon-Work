# My Updated Story
Through my development of the project I felt it was necessary to show that small and mid sized galleries are able to maintain a less volatile business model. However, while discussing how the big galleries are struggling it became apparent that the small and mid sized galleries deal with some of the same challenges they are simply at a smaller scale. With this in mind I decided to make a clear point that in a contraction of the art market and a time where retail/gallery real estate prices are incredibly high in New York regardless of size the profit margins are thin. At the same time having 4 spaces, as many large galleries do, in New York is much different than having one space. For this I will show the recent developments of retail real estate prices in New York. There has been an overall decline since 2016, but starting in 2020  there has been an increase in price per square foot. Itâ€™s important to understand that galleries aren't just occupying commercial spaces and may not buy them outright. This just gives viewers the understanding of how real estate affects how galleries operate.

# User research 

## Target audience
After viewing my [website](https://preview.shorthand.com/K9fd92B6kSiYK8RA) I want to pitch my story to people who are interested in starting their art collection or current collectors who want a better understanding of the art market


## Interview script


| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Do new collectors understand the story? | What graphs stood out to you the most and why? |
| What are the main take aways? | If you could tell someone about the graphs and story what would you say? |
| Do the colors of the graphs make sense? | What are your thoughts on the colors of the graphs? |




## Interview findings
I think I need to change my colors of the graphs and then create a better punch-line to drive home my ideas and findings.

| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Do new collectors understand the story? | I would say it's to create a sustainable art market you have to support small and mid sized galleries, like the title implies. | I think this shows that the art market is struggling, but mid-sized galleries aren't being affected as much|
| What are the main take aways? | I think it's clear that buying art from small and mid sized galleries is the best way to support a growing sector in the art market | It seems like large galleries have such high overhead costs it's difficult to stay open |
| Do the colors of the graphs make sense? | I think the graph could use some touching up to go to match the website theme | The graphs stand out a little in the website. | The blue seems random compared to the other colors in the website. |


# Identified changes for Part III
I'll be changing the colors of the graphs to match the theme of the website. I think having a more clear conclusion and call to action may have a more positive outcome in how people walk away from the website.
