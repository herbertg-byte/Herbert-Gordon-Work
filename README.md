# Herb's Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  For each assignment I worked to push my understanding of effective data visualization. I find this is a invaluable skill at any level of management. It helps me display, not only, raw data given to me, but the ability to truly undertsand data on a deeper level, thus give organizations a better understanding of their performance. 

# About me
My name is Herbert Gordon, I was born in New York, but raised in Pittsburgh. In 2024 I graduated from The University of Pittsburgh majoring in English literature and Classics. I graduated with departmental honors in Classics, writing, _Homer To Harring: Classical Myth in Late Twentieth Century Art_, as a culmination of my research of art and ancient civilizations, mytghologies, and cultures.  I love the arts and their ability to communicate across culture and how they can express an infinate number of feelings. I love working in art galleries and museums because it allows people to connect with other in ways they might not have expected. I strive to create spaces where these connections are invited, and the gallery is converted into a safe space without the social pressures or barriers it is commonly perceived to have. In my personal life I love to play tennis and rock climb, spending time with friends, and exploring food and culture.

# What I hope to learn
I hope through this class I can learn how to present data that is more digestible. I think that the arts are vastly bias to qualitative values, however in order to be successful they must also adopt quantitative data. I would love to learn how to show data to a diverse background, and still be effective in showing what the data displays  

1. Utilize color theory 
2. Effectively emphasize specific data points without ignoring other data
3. Creatively display quantitative data to engage viewers

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)


# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)
> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/pt-br/@charlesdeluvio?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">charlesdeluvio</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/K4mSJ7kc0As?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>
  

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.
