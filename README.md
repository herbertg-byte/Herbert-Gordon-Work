# Herb's Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  For each assignment I worked to push my understanding of effective data visualization. I find this is a invaluable skill at any level of management. It helps me display, not only, raw data given to me, but the ability to truly undertsand data on a deeper level, thus give organizations a better understanding of their performance. 

# About me
My name is Herbert Gordon, I was born in New York, but raised in Pittsburgh. In 2024 I graduated from The University of Pittsburgh majoring in English literature and Classics. I graduated with departmental honors in Classics, writing, _Homer To Harring: Classical Myth in Late Twentieth Century Art_, as a culmination of my research of art and ancient civilizations, mytghologies, and cultures.  I love the arts and their ability to communicate across culture and how they can express an infinate number of feelings. I love working in art galleries and museums because it allows people to connect with other in ways they might not have expected. I strive to create spaces where these connections are invited, and the gallery is converted into a safe space without the social pressures or barriers it is commonly perceived to have. In my personal life I love to play tennis and rock climb, spending time with friends, and exploring food and culture.

# What I hope to learn
I hope through this class I can learn how to present data that is more digestible. I think that the arts are vastly bias to qualitative values, however in order to be successful they must also adopt quantitative data. I would love to learn how to show data to a diverse background, and still be effective in showing what the data displays  

1. Utilize color theory 
2. Effectively emphasize specific data points without ignoring other data
3. Creatively display quantitative data to engage viewers

## Critique and Redesign of Forbes Worldâ€™s Highest-Paid Athletes, 2023
For this assignment I took a [table](https://www.forbes.com/lists/athletes/?sh=162054105b7e) from Forbes that simply listed out the 50 highest paid athletes of 2023. I thought that for sports fans, many of which are stats obsessed, a more creative way to show this data would be better. I thought about what sports fans value and from there made decisions to group every athlete by their respective sport. However, I still wanted to create a visually apealing graph that showed the hierarchy of the earners. I found that a tree-map was a great way to categorize while also showing the highest earners in each category. In my original design I did not have any hierarchy of text within a section, and thing caused some difficulties for some of my peers when they first saw my graph. I took this into consideration when I went into my redesign. I prioritized the net anount of earnings over the name of the athletes and their rank. I think a major takeaway from this dataset is the vast amount of money that athletes are making in the twenty-first centry. Seeing a number like $100 million makes people stop and think about how much these players are making. Additionally, my classmates brought the graph's legend to my attention. At first it was displayed in alphabetical order. They said that because 'auto racing' was at the top their eyes immediately drawn to the yellow section of the graph, which with all due respect, does not make up a significant portion of the graph. I also want to note the color of each category. To the best of my ability I used colors that would reflect the sport. It is a very minute detail that makes a difference when readers see each sport. The orange of the basketball category reflects the orange basketball, the red of the boxing category draws on red boxing gloves, and a dark brown to resemble an american football.

My classmates led me to change the hierarchy of the text and add the ranking of each athlete and I was able to impliment that in my final graph. However, something I was not able to impliment was making the top earners in each category stand out. I wanted to do this by having the top earners have an 100% opacity while the others in the category would have a 85% opacity. I was disapointed I could not figure this out on my own. I even asked Gemini, Google's generative AI, for help, but after coding new calculations for Tableau, I was not able to get the visual effect I wanted. I think this was a valuble lesson. Especially in the data visual field, the data's story must remain the focal point. I was not willing to sacrifice the data's story to add a special effect to my visual design. Finally I'm proud of how I took this bleak table from the article and created my own interpretation. It shows how data visualizion can tell an entirely new story based on how it is presented.

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)


# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)
> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/pt-br/@charlesdeluvio?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">charlesdeluvio</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/K4mSJ7kc0As?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>
  

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.
