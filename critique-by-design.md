# Redesigning The Highest Paid Athletes of 2023 table 

For this assignment I took a [table](https://www.forbes.com/lists/athletes/?sh=162054105b7e) from Forbes that simply listed out the 50 highest paid athletes of 2023. I thought that for sports fans, many of which are stats obsessed, a more creative way to show this data would be better. I thought about what sports fans value and from there made decisions to group every athlete by their respective sport. However, I still wanted to create a visually apealing graph that showed the hierarchy of the earners. I found that a tree-map was a great way to categorize while also showing the highest earners in each category. In my original design I did not have any hierarchy of text within a section, and thing caused some difficulties for some of my peers when they first saw my graph. I took this into consideration when I went into my redesign. I prioritized the net anount of earnings over the name of the athletes and their rank. I think a major takeaway from this dataset is the vast amount of money that athletes are making in the twenty-first centry. Seeing a number like $100 million makes people stop and think about how much these players are making. Additionally, my classmates brought the graph's legend to my attention. At first it was displayed in alphabetical order. They said that because 'auto racing' was at the top their eyes immediately drawn to the yellow section of the graph, which with all due respect, does not make up a significant portion of the graph. I also want to note the color of each category. To the best of my ability I used colors that would reflect the sport. It is a very minute detail that makes a difference when readers see each sport. The orange of the basketball category reflects the orange basketball, the red of the boxing category draws on red boxing gloves, and a dark brown to resemble an american football.

My classmates led me to change the hierarchy of the text and add the ranking of each athlete and I was able to impliment that in my final graph. However, something I was not able to impliment was making the top earners in each category stand out. I wanted to do this by having the top earners have an 100% opacity while the others in the category would have a 85% opacity. I was disapointed I could not figure this out on my own. I even asked Gemini, Google's generative AI, for help, but after coding new calculations for Tableau, I was not able to get the visual effect I wanted. I think this was a valuble lesson. Especially in the data visual field, the data's story must remain the focal point. I was not willing to sacrifice the data's story to add a special effect to my visual design. Finally I'm proud of how I took this bleak table from the article and created my own interpretation. It shows how data visualizion can tell an entirely new story based on how it is presented.
